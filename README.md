# DEX-TTS: Diffusion-based EXpressive Text-to-Speech with Style Modeling on Time-Variability

This repository is the official implementation of DEX-TTS: Diffusion-based EXpressive Text-to-Speech with Style Modeling on Time-Variability. 

In this repository, we provide steps for running DEX-TTS and GeDEX-TTS. 

You can find each repository in ```./DEX-TTS``` and ```./GeDEX-TTS```.

The code will be provided in the near future.

🙏 We recommend you visit our [demo site](https://dextts.github.io/demo.github.io/). 🙏
